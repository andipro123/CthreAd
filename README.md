<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

CthreAd is a multi-threading library which implements POSIX compliant threads in the Linux userland. Primarily, we have implemented two models of multi-threading:

* **One-One**

    One-One model of multi-threading maps each user-level thread with a kernel-level thread. All the threads can access the kernel at the same time. Even if a thread makes a blocking system call (i/o, etc.), other threads can continue to run.

    <br></br>

* **Many-One**

    The many to one model maps many of the user threads to a single kernel thread. This model is quite efficient as the user space manages the thread management. The library performs the context-switch and scheduling operations.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
 
## Usage

To use CthreAd in your projects:

* Clone the repository using
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/andipro123/cthread.git
    ```
* Move to the directory and choose the model you want to implement
    ```bash
    # for one-one
    $ cd cthread/one-one

    # for many-one
    $ cd cthread/many-one
    ```
* Compile the library
    ```bash
    $ gcc cthread.c -c -Wall

    #for many-one, use "cthread2.c"
    ```
* Include the header file in your project
    ```c
    // Your C program

    #include<cthread.h>
    .
    .
    .
    ```
* Compile your project using
    ```bash
    $ gcc <your-project.c> cthread.o - o <your-project>

    #for many-one, use "cthread2.o"
    ```

## Testing

The library comes with an automatic testing package to test all the functionalities of the threading library. Tests cover all areas of multi-threading to ensure that  basic functions are working as expected. To run the tests:

```bash 
$ make run
```
